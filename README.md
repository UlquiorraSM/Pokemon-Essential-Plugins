# Pokemon Essential Plugins
Here you can find all my Pokemon Essentials plugins; you can use them for your own projects.

# Ulquiorra Lifemon
This is a plugin whose encounter function is more clearly designed; it currently includes the following:

1: Random Names
Pokémon have a chance of having a nickname; such Pokémon, if caught, also have a different OT than your trainer name, as these are Pokémon that were released by their former trainers.

2: Random Variants
You can use multiple sprite variants for each Pokémon (mainly only the front), this also works great with the Evolution System and offers more variations.

3: Random status effects
At night, Pokémon spawn in the "Sleep" state; this is configurable, and you can set multiple sleep states for different Pokémon, also based on day/night cycles.

4: Random HP
Pokémon have a chance to spawn with reduced HP; perhaps they battled beforehand or something. Who knows? Pokémon with less than 50% HP sometimes spawn with the paralysis status.

5: Release and find Pokemon
In the Summary Screen, you can now release your Pokémon. If you do this, it will be saved on the current map and you can encounter your released Pokémon.

6: Define important Pokémon
You can now define Pokémon that will spawn with a certain chance; for example, Ash's old Butterfree, which he released, can be encountered on Map 5.
