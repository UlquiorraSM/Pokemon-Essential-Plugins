Lifemon -

95% of everything is mentioned and explained in the script.

However, for the recovery system for the release, you will need this section:

"
MenuHandlers.add(:party_menu, :release, {
  "name"      => _INTL("Release"),
  "order"     => 70, # Appears near the bottom of the action list
  "condition" => proc { |screen, party, party_idx| 
    # Logic: Cannot release eggs or the very last member of your team
    next party.length > 1 && !party[party_idx].egg? 
  },
  "effect"    => proc { |screen, party, party_idx|
    pkmn = party[party_idx]
    
    # Standard security confirmation
    if screen.pbConfirm(_INTL("Release this Pokémon?"))
      if pkmn.hasItem?
        screen.pbDisplay(_INTL("Please take the item from the Pokémon first."))
      else
        # Trigger the Lifemon Recovery System
        EventHandlers.trigger(:on_pokemon_released, pkmn)
        
        screen.pbDisplay(_INTL("{1} was released into the wild.", pkmn.name))
        screen.pbDisplay(_INTL("Bye-bye, {1}!", pkmn.name))
        
        # --- CLEAN REMOVAL LOGIC ---
        party.delete_at(party_idx) # Remove from array
        
        # If we released the last Pokémon in the list, move the cursor up
        party_idx = party.length - 1 if party_idx >= party.length
        
        # Hard refresh updates the sprites and positions immediately
        screen.pbHardRefresh 
        
        # Brief fade or wait can be added here if you want it even smoother
        echoln ">>> [LIFEMON] Party menu cleaned after release." if LifemonConfig::SHOW_DEBUG_LOGS
      end
    end
  }
})
"

You insert this under UI_Summary, I recommend line 1486, after "MenuHandlers.add(:party_menu_item, :move"
